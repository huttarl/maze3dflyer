maze3dflyer

A graphics demo that generates and displays random 3D mazes
and lets them be navigated by keyboard control.
In the future, a screensaver with autopilot is planned.


To install from a zip archive:

Extract the contents (executable and Data folder) somewhere so that the maze3dflyer.exe and the Data folder are siblings.


Use:
Run the executable (maze3dflyer.exe) from the folder that is the parent of Data.


Controls:

WASD: move
Arrow keys: turn
Mouse: steer (if mouse grab is on)
Home/End: go to maze entrance/exit
Enter: toggle autopilot (not yet implemented)
P: show path from entrance to exit (not yet implemented)
Space: snap camera position/orientation to grid

T: toggle frames-per-second display
F: cycle texture filter mode
